## Roman numeral converter

This is a challenge from Pincamp, made by Debbie Derks.


I have chosen to do the project with ReactJS and it is set up with 'create-react-app'. I have worked with ReactJS before during my internship and this way I can show some extra skills.
 
#### CSS methodology
The CSS metrology used is inspired by SMACSS and BEM.

Every block component starts with b-component. Layout starts with l-layout. When you go deeper into the component, the component starts with the component name, then added with ‘-‘ and a name. Like for example: component-inner. Variants start with is-variant.

#### Extras 

- Component-based
- Cross-browser development
- Responsive for all devices
- Variable web fonts
- React Context/ state management
- Sticky footer
- Favicon
- Live version on GH-pages
